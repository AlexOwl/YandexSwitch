# üîß Initial setup

First of all, you need to get the localKey and devId of your switch

There are a lot of ways to pull it, but here is the easiest way:

1. You must have the android device, because we need to install old version of the tuya app and you can't install old version on ios, so find the android device or use emulator
2. Download [Smart Life v.3.4.1](https://apkpure.com/smart-life-smart-living/com.tuya.smartlife/versions) and install it on your android device
3. Register/Login to your Tuya account and add Yandex Switch as the normal Tuya Wi-Fi switch
4. Connect your android device and laptop/pc to the same router
5. If you don't have installed NodeJS, download [it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and install
6. Open cmd/Terminal and install [tuyapi/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tuyapi/cli) package using the following command: `npm i @tuyapi/cli -g`
7. Type `tuya-cli list-app` command and follow the instructions

P.S.
1. Instead of scanning qr-code you can type open `http://ip-of-your-laptop:8002/ca.pem`
2. Use parameter `--ip` if the wrong ip was chosen by `tuya-cli`
3. Use retrieved `id` parameter as `device_id` and `key` as `local_key`

## Advanced
